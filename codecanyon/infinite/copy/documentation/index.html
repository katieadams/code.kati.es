		<h3 id="about"><strong>A) About The Script.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Infinite Pages was designed for displaying large pieces of HTML data in more manageable chunks. When the reader reaches the end of the page, the script loads more content.</p>

<p>It implements an 'infinite scroll' mechanism to load data, so the reader doesn't have to load enormous amounts
of text / images onto the page all at once. This ensures a more comfortable reading experience for the user.</p>

<p>Infinite Pages works by 'paginating' your data, and then feeding that data to the user 'on demand'.
This technique is known as 'lazy loading', and is becoming more and more common on the internet.
An example of infinite scrolling is Google Images, where content is loaded as requested by the user.</p>

<p>The script also works with images. That is to say, if your data has an &lt;IMG&gt; HTML tag inside it,
it will be loaded onto that page as requested.</p>

<p>Infinite Pages is easy to setup on your site, and is also very customizable. The possibilities you can achieve with
this script are nearly 'infinite' in themselves.</p>

		<h3 id="implementation"><strong>B) Implementation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

To implement Infinite Pages on your site, you will only need the following code placed inside the &lt;head&gt; tag of your document:

<pre>
&lt;link href="page.html.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery-1.4.2.js" type="text/javascript">&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="init.unpacked.js" type="text/javascript">&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

'init.unpacked.js' is the main <i>infinite pages</i> script itself. 'page.html.css' is just some sample styles we have added to the page. If you decide to edit this, try keeping the <i>.throbber</i> CSS class as this is the code needed to keep our little loading graphic 'stuck' on the page as data is loaded .The actual design of 'page.html' was deliberately kept to a minimum to allow room for customisation.

If you want, you are free to play around with your own styles and customisations. And just as a sidenote; you can include the latest version of Jquery on your page by using the following code:

<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://jquery.com/src/jquery-latest.pack.js">&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Inside our &lt;BODY&gt; tag, there are three elements you must include to have infinite pages on your site:</p>

<pre>

&lt;div class="throbber">&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="about"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" id="next"&gt;Click here to load some data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="content">&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<ul>
<li>The <i>throbber</i> DIV is the small loading graphic you see when data is being loaded.</li>
<li>The <i>about</i> DIV contains the initialisation link, which loads the first bit of data (And disappears after clicking).</li>
<li>The <i>content</i> DIV is where the actual data / content is loaded to</li>
</ul>

<p>These elements must be included, as they are required for the script to work. In our example demo <a href="http://demos.eire-media.com/infinite/">located here</a>, there is a small banner graphic at the top of the page for demonstration purposes only. It is not required of the script that you have this.

		<h3 id="php"><strong>C) PHP Notes</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
<p>All our data is stored in a file called 'data.txt'. This is really a HTML file in disguise. Note the actual text is HTML markup. But you are certainly free to include raw text in your document, providing it has line breaks.

<p>In this script, we will be loading 150 lines of text at a time. The script works by chopping the data contained in 'data.txt' into 150-line segments. You can decide how many lines of text each page displays by going to line 70 of 'grab.php' and editing the value.

<pre>
$display = 150;
</pre>

<p>
<i>$display</i> is how many LINES you will need parsed per page. 150 Is the default value, and is a 'safe bet' if you want to keep your readers satisfied. Decreasing this value may break the script, depending on what content is displayed on the page.</p>

<p>[ The first page's 'data-height' MUST exceed the height of the page in order to work ]</p>

<p>All this means is, 150 lines of text is sufficient for the script to work. You can access different pages of the script by saying:</p>

<pre>
http://www.example.com/infinite/grab.php?p=1
http://www.example.cominfinite/grab.php?p=2
http://www.example.com/infinite/grab.php?p=3
</pre>

<p>Where 'p' is the page of the data you are requesting. Note: In order for the script to determine if you have reached the end of the page, you <b>must</b> include the following code into the very bottom of your data-file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;p style="visibility:hidden">xxfinishedxx&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>This is a signal to the script you have reached the end of your content, and no more data will be loaded, or scrolled. You can change the file-name of 'data.txt' to anything you like, e.g;</p>

<ul>
<li>'content.html'</li>
<li>'text.dat'</li>
<li>'stuff.txt'</li>
</ul>

<p>The extension doesn't matter. If you don't want people seeing your data-file then be clever in the naming process.
In our live example, you can access it at:</p>

<p>http://demos.eire-media.com/infinite/data.txt</p>

<p>But make sure you change the relative name of the file in 'grab.php'</p>

<p>On line 77, you will see:

<pre>
$data = file('data.txt');
</pre>

<p>
Change this to whatever you see fit.
</p>

<p>
When you are happy with your data file and modified it with your own content, 
Then upload the 'content' folder to your server. So it points to something like this:
</p>

<pre>
http://www.example.com/content/
</pre>

<ul>
<li><b>** You will need to CHMOD the file data.txt to 777 **</b></li>
<li><b>** This is a permission on the server which grants PHP files the permission to read the file **</b></li>
</ul>

		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="custom"><strong>D) Types of Content &amp;&nbsp;Customisation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

<p>
Before you upload any files to the server, you must first prepare the content you want for your readership.
In our <a href="http://demos.eire-media.com/infinite/">live example</a>, we've included a <a href="http://demos.eire-media.com/infinite/data.txt">royalty free version of Shakespeare's Hamlet.</a> The text is repeated countless times to simulate a huge book of text. When you reach the end of the book, you will be alerted by the script.
</p>

<p>It must be noted that Infinite Pages is not limited to textual data. You can implement various different types of data into the script. Examples would be:

<ul>
<li>Image galleries</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Youtube Videos</li>
<li>Code snippets</li>
<li>Readmes</li>
<li>Portfolio information</li>
<li>Use your imagination!</li>
</ul>

<p>
You may rebrand this application as you see fit. Also noteworthy is the fact that any data loaded can be styled and formatted on the 'host page', <i>before</i> it is loaded. For example, you may add this to your CSS:

<pre>
h1{font-family:Verdana;}
</pre>

<p>This means any H1 tags which are loaded are styled as such.</p>

You can change the appearance and color of the AJAX 'throbber' / loader image by going to:<br/>
<a href="http://www.ajaxload.info">http://www.ajaxload.info</a>
</p>




<p>
By default, the actual Infinite Pages .HTML page is contained in a wrapper frame.
This is purely for presentational purposes, and can be excluded if you want.
If so, you will only need page.html to display your content.
</p>

<p>
As this script was tested (and works) in Safari, I see no reason it shouldn't work on an iPhone aswell.
All the content is by default set to display at 100% of the screen width,
so the text will 'wrap' quite nicely to the screen. If you choose to go down this avenue,
I would exclude the wrapper frame contained in 'index.html'
